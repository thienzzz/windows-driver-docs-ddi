# GetNearNameByOffset method
The <b>GetNearNameByOffset</b>  method returns the name of a symbol that is located near the specified location.

## Syntax

````
HRESULT GetNearNameByOffset(
  [in]            ULONG64  Offset,
  [in]            LONG     Delta,
  [out, optional] PSTR     NameBuffer,
  [in]            ULONG    NameBufferSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG   NameSize,
  [out, optional] PULONG64 Displacement
);
````

## Parameters

`Offset`

Specifies the location in the target's virtual address space of the symbol from which the desired symbol is determined.

`Delta`

Specifies the relationship between the desired symbol and the symbol located at <i>Offset</i>.  If positive, the engine will return the symbol that is <i>Delta</i> symbols after the symbol located at <i>Offset</i>.  If negative, the engine will return the symbol that is <i>Delta</i> symbols before the symbol located at <i>Offset</i>.

`NameBuffer`

Receives the symbol's name.  The name is qualified by the module to which the symbol belongs (for example, <b>mymodule!main</b>).  If <i>NameBuffer</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`NameBufferSize`

Specifies the size in characters of the buffer <i>NameBuffer</i>.

`NameSize`

Receives the size in characters of the symbol's name.  If <i>NameSize</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.

`Displacement`

Receives the difference between the value of <i>Offset</i> and the location in the target's memory address space of the symbol.  If <i>Displacement</i> is <b>NULL</b>, this information is not returned.


## Return Value

This method may also return other error values.  See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/713f3ee2-2f5b-415e-9908-90f5ae428b43">Return Values</a> for more details.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_OK</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.
<dl>
<dt><b>S_FALSE</b></dt>
</dl>The method was successful.  However, the buffer was not large enough to hold the symbol's name so it was truncated.
<dl>
<dt><b>E_NOINTERFACE</b></dt>
</dl>No symbol matching the specifications of <i>Offset</i> and <i>Delta</i> was found.

## Remarks

By increasing or decreasing the value of <i>Delta</i>, these methods can be used to iterate over the target's symbols starting at a particular location.

If <i>Delta</i> is zero, these methods behave the same way as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff547183">GetNameByOffset</a>.
